## sample Equations to try

-x + 5 = (answer:5)
-x * 3 = 21 ( ansewer:7)
-100 - x = 75 (answer: 25)

## What I Learned About Search
I have learned that search can be done in three different ways and each direction result is dependent on the type of search and the subject that is being searched. This searches include best first search, depth first search and heuristic.
I also learned that if a proper algorithms is utilized in search, results are close to precise or exact.
