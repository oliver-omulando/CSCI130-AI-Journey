# Spam Detection Analysis Report 
## How My Model Learns 
the models learns by supervised learning.It utilize data that is labeled spam and not spam for analysis and differentiation. Contrary to unsupervised learning that involve unlabeled data.

### Features I Used 
1. **Word Count**:  
Spam might have different word count due to text filters, hidden text might be included or might obscured. Based on the visualization graph its clear a spam has more words than not spam email.
2. **Exclamation Marks**: 
Spammers use exclamation marks to go through filter and stand out. This is demostrated by the visualization graph.
3. **Money Words**: 
Its clear words related to "deals" , "discount", "last chance" all are relate to money and its bound to attract attention. This is demostarted in one of the graph as the dominant subject of spammers.
4. **ALL CAPS**:
It obvious communication in all caps is either aggressive and not normal. For this reason it can be grouped as spam.
## Training Results - Training Accuracy: [Your result]% - Testing Accuracy: [Your result]% 
The model options 1. is clearly on point regarding the words or data that it should focus on. The results are outsatanding based in the little information i inputed.
### What This Means 
This results validate that correct and accurate data is critcal to decern waht is spam and what is not. 
## Preventing Overfitting 
Overfitting can be avoided by diversifying data that are unique from the current examples. In addition, keeping models simple is key.
## Real-World Application 
If this was used by Gmail the expected stengths could be ideal and effective for basic. The weakness could be vulnerable due to data not being diverse. More data might be needed to filter more spam because I get spam sometimes and i have Gmail. Plus, some legit mails get filtered to spam and are not.
 
## What I Learned 
I have learned that AI model can be trained and aid in task that can be as simple as separating legit emails from spam email. This is possible by providing the data that can be a foundation to distinguish the key indicators. This can be improved by providng a diverse of information that can expand the purpose and not limit to just keys indcators. Separate test data and keeping the model simple is important to avoid overfitting.
